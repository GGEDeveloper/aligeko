# Operations (Ops) Reference

This document defines commonly used operations for the AliTools B2B project.

## Standard Operations

### op1: Deploy to Vercel

When asked to "run op1" or "execute op1", this means:

1. Run the Vercel build process
2. Update the repository with the latest changes
3. Complete the deployment to Vercel

**Command Sequence:**
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Commit and push changes (if there are uncommitted changes)
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Preparing for deployment"
git push

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

This operation should be executed when changes need to be published to the live environment.
