# Successful Deployment Configuration

This document records the configuration details for successful deployment of the AliTools B2B platform to Vercel. This should be used as a reference for all future deployments.

## Deployment Date
- Latest successful deployment: June 15, 2025
- Environment: Production

## Key Configuration Files

### 1. vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { 
      "src": "index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.js" }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

### 3. package.json scripts
```json
"scripts": {
  "build:client": "cd client && npm install && npm run build",
  "build:server": "cd server && npm install && npm run build",
  "build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server",
  "vercel-build": "npm run build:client || echo 'Client build failed but continuing deployment'",
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

## Deployment Steps

1. Ensure client/dist contains the latest build:
   ```bash
   npm run build:client
   ```

2. Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard

3. Deploy from the root directory:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Important Notes

- The key to successful deployment is using a simplified `vercel.json` that delegates all routing to the Express server
- Static files are served by Express, not Vercel's static handlers
- The `vercel-build` script is made resilient with the `|| echo` pattern to continue even if there are non-critical build issues
- All direct URL accesses (like `/products`) are handled by the Express catch-all route that sends `index.html`

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly with all assets
- [ ] Navigation between routes works
- [ ] Direct URL access works (e.g., `/products`, `/about`)
- [ ] API endpoints return correct data
- [ ] No redirection loops or URL parameter accumulation
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Static assets (JS, CSS, images) load with correct MIME types
