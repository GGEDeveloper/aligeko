## Recent Fixes

### Empty Products API Response (Fixed)

- **Date:** [2025-05-21 15:45]
- **Error Type:** API / Database / Response Format
- **Environment:** Production
- **Error Message:** 
  ```
  Products not displaying despite database having records
  API response returning empty items array with correct metadata
  ```
- **Root Cause:** 
  - Multiple issues in the API endpoint were identified:
    1. The SQL query in index.js was using improper case for the table name ('Products' instead of 'products')
    2. The count query result was not being properly extracted
    3. The API response format wasn't handling single products correctly, returning a single object instead of an array
    4. The client-side wasn't properly handling the API response

- **Resolution:** 
  1. Fixed SQL query case sensitivity to use lowercase 'products' table name throughout
  2. Corrected the count extraction to properly use the 'count' field
  3. Ensured API response always returns an array of products:
     ```javascript
     const productsArray = Array.isArray(productsResult) ? productsResult : [productsResult].filter(Boolean);
     ```
  4. Updated client-side productApi.js to ensure consistent handling of API responses:
     ```javascript
     items: Array.isArray(items) ? items : [items].filter(Boolean)
     ```
  5. Added more robust error handling and detailed logging
  6. Added fallback utilities in ProductsPage for error tracking and debounce functions

- **Verification:** 
  - API now returns products with correct array format:
    ```json
    {"success":true,"data":{"items":[{...product data...}],"meta":{"totalItems":9231,"totalPages":924,"currentPage":1,"itemsPerPage":10}}}
    ```
  - Client-side now displays products on the products page
  - Verified pagination works correctly with all 9,231 products
  - Verified that search and filtering functionality works correctly

- **Affected Files:** 
  - `index.js` - Fixed SQL queries and response format
  - `client/src/store/api/productApi.js` - Updated response handling
  - `client/src/pages/ProductsPage.jsx` - Added fallback utilities for error tracking and debounce

- **Prevention:**
  1. Use TypeScript to catch type errors and ensure consistent response formats
  2. Add more comprehensive error handling in API endpoints
  3. Implement standardized response formats with proper typing
  4. Create integration tests to verify API responses match expected format
  5. Develop a database models layer to abstract SQL queries and avoid table name mistakes
  6. Add schema validation for API requests/responses
  7. Establish clear conventions for database naming and case sensitivity

### Oversized Icons in CategoryCard Component (Fixed)

- **Date:** [2025-05-07 15:45]
- **Error Type:** Frontend / UI / Styling
- **Environment:** Production
- **Error Message:** n/a - Visual issue
- **Root Cause:** 
  - The CategoryCard component was using react-icons/bs with size={32} which was too large
  - Icons were displayed without proper size constraints, causing layout issues
  - Missing container constraints allowed icons to dictate their own size
  - No fallback system for custom SVG icons was implemented

- **Resolution:**
  1. Reduced icon size from 32px to 24px in the CategoryCard component
  2. Added a fixed-size container (w-12 h-12) with flexbox centering to constraint icons
  3. Implemented a proper fallback system for icons that checks for custom SVG icons first
  4. Added support for custom SVG icons in categoryData.js
  5. Modified the grid layout in ProductsPage to be more responsive
  6. Created comprehensive icon usage pattern documentation

- **Verification:**
  - Verified icons display at correct size across all breakpoints
  - Confirmed icons maintain proper alignment in their containers
  - Tested custom icon system with fallback
  - Validated on different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior

- **Affected Files:**
  - `client/src/components/products/CategoryCard.jsx`
  - `client/src/utils/categoryData.js`
  - `client/src/pages/ProductsPage.jsx`
  - `.cursor/rules/icons.mdc` (new file)

- **Prevention:**
  1. Document icon sizing guidelines in the cursor rules
  2. Use consistent container sizing patterns for all icons
  3. Always implement fallback mechanisms for all visual components
  4. Test UI components across different screen sizes before deployment
  5. Use the new icons.mdc rule as reference for future icon implementations

### Missing Utility Modules in ProductsPage (Fixed)

- **Date:** [2025-05-20 14:30]
- **Error Type:** Frontend / Import / Missing Files
- **Environment:** Production
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  Uncaught Error: Cannot find module '../utils/errorTracking'
  Uncaught Error: Cannot find module '../utils/debounce'
  ```
- **Root Cause:** 
  - The ProductsPage component was importing utility modules that didn't exist: `errorTracking.js` and `debounce.js`
  - These modules were referenced but never created in the codebase
  - This caused runtime errors when the application was built and deployed

- **Resolution:**
  1. Created missing utility files:
     - Added `errorTracking.js` with proper error tracking functionality
     - Added `debounce.js` with debounce implementation
  2. Alternative approach: Inline implementations directly in the component
     - Implemented debounce functionality directly within the component
     - Added error logging fallback with console.error
     - Used a global window.trackErrors hook for extensibility

- **Verification:**
  - Build completed successfully with no module import errors
  - Tested the search functionality to verify debounce works properly
  - Verified error handling by triggering filter errors
  - Deployed to production environment

- **Affected Files:**
  - `client/src/utils/errorTracking.js` - Created new file
  - `client/src/utils/debounce.js` - Created new file
  - `client/src/pages/ProductsPage.jsx` - Modified to handle missing utilities gracefully

- **Prevention:**
  1. Use TypeScript to catch missing imports at compile time
  2. Implement pre-build checks to verify module dependencies
  3. Add unit tests to verify component imports resolve correctly
  4. Create shared utility libraries with consistent naming and documentation
  5. Document utility dependencies in component comments

### Oversized Search Icons (Fixed)

- **Date:** [2025-05-08 10:30]
- **Error Type:** Frontend / UI / Styling
- **Environment:** Production
- **Error Message:** n/a - Visual issue
- **Root Cause:** 
  - The search icons in both the ProductsPage and Header components were too large
  - In the ProductsPage, the icon was 5x5 pixels and using a dark gray color (gray-400)
  - In the Header component, the desktop search icon was set to 1.1rem
  - The mobile search input in the Header component was missing a search icon entirely

- **Resolution:**
  1. Reduced the ProductsPage search icon size from 5x5 px to 4x4 px
  2. Changed the ProductsPage icon color from gray-400 to gray-500 for better contrast
  3. Reduced the Header component desktop search icon from 1.1rem to 0.9rem
  4. Added a search icon to the mobile search input with appropriate sizing (0.8rem)
  5. Ensured proper positioning and styling of all search icons for consistency

- **Verification:**
  - Visually verified that all search icons are appropriately sized
  - Confirmed that mobile and desktop experiences are consistent
  - Checked that the icons maintain proper alignment and contrast
  
- **Affected Files:**
  - `client/src/pages/ProductsPage.jsx` - Reduced icon size and adjusted color
  - `client/src/components/ui/Header.jsx` - Reduced desktop icon size and added mobile icon

- **Prevention:**
  1. Added guidelines for icon sizing in the cursor rules documentation
  2. Established standard sizes for different UI elements (24px for category icons, max 16px for inline search icons)
  3. Ensured mobile/desktop consistency in all icon implementations
