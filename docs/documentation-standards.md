# Documentation Standards

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-23 16:30]  
**Author:** Documentation Team  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

This document establishes the official standards for all documentation in the AliTools B2B platform. Following these standards ensures consistent, trackable, and maintainable documentation across the project.

## Timestamp Requirements

### Format and Structure

All documentation updates, code changes, and project artifacts MUST include timestamps in the following format:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
```

Example: `[2023-06-23 16:30]`

### Required Elements

For significant documentation updates or new entries, include the following elements:

1. **Timestamp header** at the beginning of each entry
2. **Author** name or identifier (when applicable)
3. **Changes/Description** of what was updated
4. **Related Files** that were affected
5. **Version** number when applicable

### Example Full Format

```markdown
## Feature Name or Documentation Section

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-23 10:15]  
**Author:** Jane Smith  
**Changes:**  
- Added new authentication flow documentation
- Updated API endpoint references
- Fixed incorrect database schema diagrams  
**Related Files:**  
- `docs/development/auth-flow.md`
- `docs/database/schema.md`  
**Version:** v1.2.3
```

### Simplified Format for Minor Changes

For smaller updates, a simplified format can be used:

```markdown
**Update [2023-06-23 11:30]:** Fixed typo in API endpoint URL and updated screenshot.
```

## Application Areas

### 1. Documentation Files

- Each markdown file should include a timestamp at the top of the document
- Section updates within a document should include their own timestamps
- Changelog entries must have timestamps

### 2. Code Comments

For significant code changes, include a timestamp in the comment:

```javascript
/**
 * Authentication middleware
 * [2023-06-20 14:45] Updated to use JWT validation instead of session cookies
 * @param {Request} req - Express request object
 * @param {Response} res - Express response object
 * @param {Function} next - Express next function
 */
function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### 3. Pull Requests

Pull request descriptions should begin with:

```
**Timestamp:** [2023-06-22 09:30]
```

### 4. Issue Tracking

When updating issues or tickets, include the timestamp at the beginning of new comments or status changes.

## Benefits of Timestamp Standards

1. **Traceability**: Timeline of when specific information was added or modified
2. **Correlation**: Ability to connect documentation changes with code changes
3. **Freshness Indicator**: Clear indication of how recent information is
4. **Accountability**: Record of who made specific changes (when author is included)
5. **Version History**: Simplified tracking of documentation evolution

## Implementation In Different Document Types

### API Documentation

```markdown
## POST /api/users

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 11:20]

Creates a new user in the system.

### Request Body

### Configuration Guides

```markdown
# Environment Configuration

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-10 14:35]  
**Last Updated:** [2023-06-22 09:15]

## Overview

### Meeting Notes

```markdown
# Sprint Planning Meeting

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-19 10:00-11:30]  
**Attendees:** John, Sarah, Miguel, Lisa

## Agenda

```

## Retroactive Updates

When updating existing documentation that doesn't follow these standards:

1. Add a timestamp for your current update
2. If known, add approximate timestamps for previous major additions
3. Add a note indicating that historical timestamps are approximate

## Enforcing Documentation Standards

- All PRs that include documentation changes will be checked for timestamp compliance
- Automated tests will scan markdown files for proper timestamp formats
- Documentation reviews will include verification of timestamp standards

---

*This documentation standard is effective immediately. All existing documentation should be updated to comply with these standards during the next documentation review cycle.*
