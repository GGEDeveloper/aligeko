# AliTools Logo Guidelines

## 1. Logo Overview

The AliTools logo represents the brand's evolution from AlimamedeTools, maintaining the core industrial identity while embracing modern design principles. The logo consists of two key elements:

- **Symbol:** A rounded square containing a wrench silhouette
- **Wordmark:** "ALI TOOLS" in bold sans-serif typography, with hierarchy between "ALI" and "TOOLS"

## 2. Logo Variations

### 2.1 Primary Logo
The primary logo is the full color version featuring the yellow/gold (#FFCC00) square with white wrench and the wordmark in the same yellow/gold color.

### 2.2 Monochromatic Version
A single-color version in solid yellow/gold (#FFCC00) against white/light backgrounds or solid white against dark backgrounds.

### 2.3 Symbol Only
The rounded square with wrench symbol can be used alone when space is limited or when the brand is already recognized in context (like favicon, app icon, etc.).

### 2.4 Wordmark Only
In cases where the icon doesn't display well, the "ALI TOOLS" wordmark can stand alone.

## 3. Spacing and Clear Space

To ensure the logo maintains its visual impact, maintain clear space around it equal to the height of the "L" in "ALI". This clear zone should be kept free of other graphic elements, text, or distracting backgrounds.

## 4. Minimum Size

To ensure legibility:
- Complete logo: Minimum width of 80px for digital use or 25mm for print
- Symbol only: Minimum width of 16px for digital use or 5mm for print

## 9. Brand Mark Rationale

The logo represents the evolution of the AlimamedeTools brand while maintaining connection to its core business:
- The wrench symbol directly communicates the tools industry
- The rounded square shape suggests reliability and solidity
- The bold typography communicates strength and precision
- The hierarchical type treatment distinguishes the brand name components

By maintaining the yellow/gold color from the original brand, the new logo ensures recognition and continuity while modernizing the overall look.
