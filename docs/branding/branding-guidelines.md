# Branding Guidelines for Migration from AlimamedeTools to AliTools

This document outlines the process for the initial investigation of visual styles (colors, logos, typography, etc.) used by **AlimamedeTools** and the guidelines for migrating to the new visual identity of **AliTools**, ensuring consistency, modernity, and alignment with 2025 design trends.

---

## 1. Objective

The goal is to analyze the current visual identity of AlimamedeTools and propose a new identity for AliTools that is:
- **Consistent**: Aligned with the project's style rules (e.g., `rules.style` in `.cursorrules`).
- **Modern**: Incorporates 2025 design trends, such as minimalism, bold colors, and responsiveness.
- **Recognizable**: Retains key elements from AlimamedeTools to maintain familiarity with existing customers while updating the brand for a broader B2B audience.
- **Adaptable**: Works across different platforms (web, mobile, print) and contexts (e.g., small sizes on mobile screens).

---

## 2. Initial Investigation Process

The agent must conduct a detailed analysis of AlimamedeTools' visual elements before starting the migration. The steps include:

### 2.1. Collection of Visual Materials
- **Sources**:
  - AlimamedeTools' official website (if available).
  - Marketing materials (e.g., catalogs, flyers, packaging).
  - Existing logos (primary, secondary, variations).
  - Social media or e-commerce platform presence.
- **Tools**:
  - Use the `puppeteer` or `playwright` server (as per `agent_behavior.senior_developer_practices.mcp_server_usage`) to capture screenshots or extract visual assets from websites.
  - Analyze color palettes with tools like Adobe Color or Coolors.

### 2.2. Documentation of Visual Elements
- **Logos**:
  - Identify the primary logo and variations (e.g., monochromatic, with background, standalone icon).
  - Analyze typography (serif or sans-serif fonts, weight, style).
  - Verify responsiveness (legibility at small sizes).
- **Color Palette**:
  - Extract primary and secondary colors (in hex format, as per `rules.style.colorFormat`).
  - Identify use of gradients, neutral tones, or vibrant colors.
- **Typography**:
  - Document fonts used (e.g., font name, weight, sizes).
  - Check for custom fonts or standard fonts (e.g., Google Fonts).
- **Icons and Graphic Elements**:
  - Analyze icons, illustrations, or graphic patterns.
  - Verify consistency in style (e.g., flat, minimalist, detailed).
- **Other Elements**:
  - Evaluate spacing usage (e.g., exclusion zones around the logo).
  - Identify existing brand guidelines, if available.

### 2.3. Investigation Report
- **Format**: Markdown document, saved as `docs/alimamedetools_branding_analysis.md`.
- **Content**:
  - List of logos with images or descriptions.
  - Color palette with hex codes.
  - Identified fonts and usage examples.
  - Analysis of strengths and weaknesses of the current identity (e.g., legibility, modernity, consistency).
  - Initial recommendations for migration.

## 3. Migration Guidelines

Based on the investigation, the agent must propose a new visual identity for AliTools, following these guidelines:

### 3.1. Logos
- **Style**: Adopt a minimalist design with clean lines and simple shapes, as per 2025 trends. Examples include logos from brands like PayPal and Lamborghini, which adopted bold and minimalist designs.
- **Variations**:
  - Create at least four logo variations: primary, secondary, monochromatic, and standalone icon.
  - Ensure responsiveness for different platforms (web, mobile, print).
- **Typography**: Prefer sans-serif fonts for modernity and legibility, as per `rules.style` and examples from brands like Google and Uber.
- **Exclusion Zone**: Define an exclusion zone around the logo (minimum of half the logo's width), as per practices of brands like Spotify and Medium.

### 3.2. Color Palette
- **Quantity**: Limit the palette to 1-2 primary colors and 1-2 secondary colors to maintain simplicity, as recommended for modern logos.
- **Style**:
  - Consider bold colors to stand out on digital platforms.
  - Include neutral tones (e.g., black, white) for versatility.
  - Explore earthy or nature-inspired tones for alignment with sustainability, if relevant to the tools sector.
- **Format**: Use hex codes, as per `rules.style.colorFormat`.
- **Proposed Example** (to be validated post-investigation):
  - Primary: #1E3A8A (dark blue, trustworthy).
  - Secondary: #F97316 (orange, energetic).
  - Neutral: #FFFFFF (white), #1F2937 (dark gray).

### 3.3. Typography
- **Fonts**: Choose modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto) for consistency with the frontend aesthetic (React.js with Tailwind CSS).
- **Sizes**:
  - Define minimum sizes for legibility (e.g., 12px for small screens).
  - Use relative units (`rem`, `em`) as per `rules.style.unitPreference`.
- **Weights**: Include variations (regular, bold) for visual hierarchy.

### 3.4. Icons and Graphic Elements
- **Style**: Adopt a flat or minimalist style with consistent line weights (e.g., uniform thickness).
- **Themes**: Incorporate elements related to tools (e.g., geometric shapes, hammer or wrench icons) to reinforce the industry identity.
- **Formats**: Ensure support for SVG for scalability, as per tools like MakeBrand LogoMaker.

### 3.5. Brand Style Guide
- **Creation**: Develop a brand style guide for AliTools, as recommended by Venngage.
- **Content**:
  - Logos (variations, correct usage, incorrect usage).
  - Color palette (hex codes, primary and secondary uses).
  - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights).
  - Icons and graphic elements (style, examples).
  - Spacing and layout rules (e.g., exclusion zones, margins).
  - Application examples (e.g., website, business cards, catalogs).
- **Format**: Markdown document, saved as `docs/alitools_brand_style_guide.md`.
- **Timeline**: Complete the guide before the MVP execution phase, as per `project_phases.execution`.
