## Timestamps for Documentation

All documentation now includes:
- Creation timestamps to indicate when documents were first created
- Update timestamps to track when significant changes were made
- Author attribution for accountability and follow-up questions
- Version tracking for major document revisions
- Consistent timestamp format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC]
- Timestamps at document beginning and end for clarity
- Sectional timestamps for major updates to specific parts

Benefits of timestamps:
- Improved tracking of documentation evolution
- Better context for understanding when information was added
- Easier identification of outdated content
- Enhanced audit trail for compliance purposes
- Simplified troubleshooting by correlating documentation changes with code changes

## Remaining Tasks

- [x] Apply new documentation standards to existing documentation
- [x] Create database schema documentation
- [ ] Standardize all cursor rules
- [ ] Complete API endpoint documentation
- [ ] Finalize error tracking procedures
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing documentation

## Next Steps

1. Address remaining documentation tasks
2. Implement peer review process for documentation
