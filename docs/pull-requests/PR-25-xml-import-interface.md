# Pull Request: XML File Upload Interface Implementation

## Summary
This PR implements a comprehensive XML file upload and import interface for the AliTools B2B platform. The feature allows administrators to upload GEKO XML files directly through the admin panel, monitor import progress, and review import history.

## Features Implemented
- Backend API endpoints for XML file uploads with validation
- Background processing of XML imports using a job queue system
- Frontend components for drag-and-drop file uploads and progress monitoring
- Import history tracking and management interface
- Comprehensive security measures including rate limiting and validation
- Unit and integration tests for the entire upload flow
- Complete user and API documentation

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components
- Created `FileUploadController` with multer middleware for handling file uploads
- Implemented `ImportJobService` for background processing of imports
- Enhanced `GekoImportService` to handle uploaded files
- Added security middleware with rate limiting, validation, and permission checks
- Integrated with existing XML import system

### Frontend Components
- Implemented drag-and-drop `XMLUploadComponent` with progress indication
- Created `ImportHistoryTable` for listing and managing imports
- Added `XMLImportPage` with documentation and guidelines
